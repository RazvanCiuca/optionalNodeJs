npm install -g gulp

Task runner. Why?
 - Automate tasks (prepare js/html/css for production)
 - jsHint
 - test runner

Gulp vs Grunt
 - Grunt: file based
 - Gulp: code instead of config files, stream-based, more node-based, more readable, easily debuggable


Gulp
 - gulp.task
 - gulp.src
 - gulp.dest
 - gulp.watch
